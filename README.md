# Almabetter_Bookmyshow
In this I have implemented the Movie booking application with a user authentication system.
In this project I have used several Programming technologies like ReactJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB.
Frontend part have been developed by using ReactJS.
Backend has been developed using ExpressJS and Database used is MongoDB.
The user authentication is implemented using JWT token and password hashing has been done there, also we store the cookies of the users.
The local server of the frontend is running on the port 3000 and backend server is running on port 8080.
To fetch the data which is Movie Data from the backend I have used the Axios.

Working

Basically when user come on the page he/she will get redirects to the Login page where he/she have to create account or have to login then only they will allowed to enter to the dashbaord of the movie booking.
Wheneber user signup his/her data will get stored in the MongoDB database in which the password is hashed.
After Login/Signup the Dashboard page gets open and user can book his/her movie.
On the Dashboard page User will get the option of the Movies, Time slot and Seats.
Afer the Booking the data of the movie gets stored in the MongoDB which is included with the Movie name , time slot and the seats.
After the successfull booking user can check his booking details in the last booking section.
At last user can Logout.

Thank you !
