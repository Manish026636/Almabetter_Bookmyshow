In this I have implemented the Movie booking application with a user authentication system.
In this project I have used several Programming technologies like ReactJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB.
Frontend part have been developed by using ReactJS.
Backend has been developed using ExpressJS and Database used is MongoDB.
The user authentication is implemented using JWT token and password hashing has been done there also we store the cookies of the users.
The only issue is there that the whenever we try to login means when we punch the input details and click on the Login/ Register button then we have to refresh the page for the output,maybe it's some routing issue that I couldn't able to sort out but ya that's what I was trying to implement in this project.
